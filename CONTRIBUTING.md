# Introduction

Nice to meet you ðŸ˜„.

Wherever we end up going from here:

Thank you for spending your precious time and valued brainpowerâ€”it is truly appreciated!

This contribution guide exists so that you and other contributors will get the most out of your effort for the least time and expenditure required. It is simpleâ€”we are looking for all and everything you view as a contribution.

# Areas To Contribute

- New documentation.
- Improving documentation.
- Writing tutorials.
- "Simple things" like spelling and grammar fixes, typo correction, white space and formatting changes.
- Sharing ideas and suggestions for new content.
- Support questionsâ€¦ Yes really! If you are facing it then you can't be the only one. It is an opportunity to better the website. Create an [Issue Report](https://github.com/TiBookEnthusiasts/tibookenthusiasts.github.io/issues/new) to ask your question since it is neither a bug report nor a feature request.
- Whatever things that *aren't* listed here that *should be*.

# Cleaning the Computer
{: .fs-9 }

"It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required."<br>
-- Winston S. Churchill
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

No matter your age, you already know how to clean things. If you are reading this, then you already know how to clean things. The goal of this document is not to explain how to clean things but rather to:

-   Document one way to do so.
-   Capture lessons learned during the process.
-   Act as either an excellent resource to quickly skim over to review a high-level approach or to read the entire thing from start to finish and follow it step by step.

# Putting It In Its Place

Unplug the TiBook.

Place one towel down on the workspace in front of you. Place the laptop on top of it. Whether your computer has feet or not, letting the towel bear the brunt of moving it around while cleaning it will protect it along with whatever feet do remain. The stock feet are very sticky and don't like to slide around on the workspace; the towel, however, does.

Since this is probably the first time seeing your new TiBook, beyond making sure that it turns on and off correctly, take the time to look it over. Give it another visual inspection to make sure you know its current condition. If you haven't tested the laptop by now, then do so in case cleaning it affected anything, no matter how unlikely. Make a mental note of how you expect it to improve after cleaning and possible areas that need extra focus. Now is an excellent high-level "Before" photo opportunity.

You'll quickly feel the pain of repeatedly referring to the machine as "your laptop," "it," "TiBook." Now you understand why people give names to their computers.


# The Template For Cleaning

This section explains the steps and actions to take to clean the TiBook.

This document refers to the surface described in each step only as "it."


## Preparation

-   Wear a glove on your cleaning hand. If you don't, then the Isopropanyl will dry out your skin. It might be easier to wear both, depending on your cleaning style.
-   Visually inspect it yet again.
-   Blow compressed air over it. If there is any substantial dirt left on it, then address it before moving forward. The toothbrush dipped in Isopropanyl might help here. As air exits, the can it becomes colder and colder; eventually, the liquid inside the can will shoot out instead of compressed air. When it reaches this point, stop and put the can down. Switch to another can while this one returns to room temperature. Read the documentation on the can to see how it works.
-   Take a cleaning towel, and apply enough Isopropanyl to make the towel damp but not dripping wet in the shape of a rectangle 2"x1" or 2.5cmx5cm.
-   Mentally delineate a square area roughly 4"x4" in or 10cmx10cm. Call it the "work surface." Perform the remaining steps on that work surface.


## Cleaning

-   Apply the towel to the surface and scrub gently and firmly in circles. Push hard enough to clean the surface. You don't need to push extremely hard though, for example, you shouldn't mar or bend it. Consider using a standard number of revolutions to perform the scrubbing. Use the same number of revolutions for each location. This standardized approach is useful for comparing the amount of dirt between sites and whether you need to spend more time there.
-   The darkness of the towel reveals the volume of dirt removed. Think about what you see. Use your gut and brain to compare the outcome with your expectation. Sometimes the cloth will be clean because there was no dirt on a rarely touched area. Very dark marks reveal high use areas.
-   What will surprise you the most is when you expected it to be dirty, but it isn't. When this happens, add some more Isopropanyl to the cloth and scrub it down again. You'll find that sometimes it takes another scrub to loosen the dirt and remove it. Remember that dirt and grime have accumulated over the last twenty years: it might need some real elbow grease to clean it up nicely.
-   Decide how many iterations of the surfaces will make you happy. Each time pay attention both to the body of the laptop and the color of the cloth. The number of revolutions and iterations that you perform quantifies the level of cleaning you performed. For example, a "casual" versus "deep" clean. From here on, you'll be cleaning in greater detail.
-  You are cleaning all of the surfaces covered in this document twice.
-  "Gentle" appears many times through this document. Although the TiBooks are old, they are still built well. There is a good chance that your laptop is strong and durable and doesn't require gentle handling. However, only you can decide that. In the absence of firsthand information about the laptop you are cleaning, the safest general approach is to perform every operation covered here gently.

## Detail Work

-   You'll stare very closely at the laptop for a long time. The more you stare at it, the more you will notice. Things that you thought were clean might need even more cleaning. Surfaces that you thought were pristine have tiny bits of dirt on them. Crevices and cracks you didn't even notice before now stand out. Now you will begin doing the detailed work.
-   You may want to use the toothbrush. For example, in fine gaps, dirt might have accrued between the white belt and the bottom. Cleaning at this level reveals the real marvel of the TiBook in how, by design, it is just tricky to get this thing very dirty. Note that wear in those close areas can look like dirt, so don't go overboard trying to clean them. Just look a little more closely before angrily scrubbing anything. The toothbrush works safely and eventually on compressed and stubborn dirt, thereby creating a lot of runoff. Keep the cloth nearby to clean off the runoff as needed. Visuall inspect the toothbrush before moistening it again from the cup of Isopropanyl. If there is a lot of dirt on the brush, you don't want to deposit it in that cup. Instead, get another cup, add Isopropanyl to it, and rinse the toothbrush there.
-   For either grime that won't release or problem areas not suited for a toothbrush, use the cotton swabs. Keep the cup *with* Isopropanyl nearby to keep the swabs damp but not dripping. If they are dripping, shake them off.
-   The dental picks provide the finest level of detailed cleaning. Be slow and gentle with them because they are balancing between the strength required for effective scrubbing and the flexibility required for getting into hard to reach places. It might take a long time to slowly work away some dirt, but it is safer than using something more aggressive and potentially damaging like a pipe cleaner. The first section of the dental pick contains scrubbing edge protrusions that are so soft and flexible as to be permanently best used with a small amount of force, so clean slowly here and see what happens. When you wear the soft part down, it bends and collapses, leaving you again with a rubber end, this time butted up against the firm plastic base. Carefully you can work harder with this firm edge. Although the hard plastic is unlikely to scratch the case, be gentle and careful to pay attention to undue wear.

**Note**: The toothbrush and dental picks can be used *almost* interchangeably. Some areas are obviously much easier for one tool versus the others. For example, brushing around the display release button using a toothbrush is easier than using a dental pick. Cleaning under keycaps with a dental pick is easier and tidier than using a toothbrush. In the remaining areas, the toothbrush and dental pick can be used interchangeably.


# Everything Outside

Before doing anything, dampen the cloth and wipe down the entire outside and inside of the laptop because:

-   It will remove a lot of dirt.
-   It will start to loosen a lot of dirt.
-   It is fun to see large results so quickly.

This alone qualifies as a "casual clean" versus "deep clean." That is not to diminish it either: you removed a lot of dirt! If you go further from here can either pick and choose parts to customize your clean or follow them step by step to do a deep clean. Do what makes you happy.

Inspired by the kick-off to cleaning the outside, now move on to the next steps.


# Start On Top

Start working on the top of the TiBook with the display release button and the optional drive slot facing you.

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very high use: people usually close their display or carry it there.
-   Perhaps use cotton swabs for the edge between the lid and the Apple logo.
-   Note the high-contact areas near the sides and middle top where the latch is. You'll see where the previous owner liked to hold their laptop because the dirty spots might not be where you expect.


# The Front

This area has the display release button and the optical drive slot.

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems very high use: turning it on or inserting disks happens a lot.
-   Use the toothbrush to scrub around the display release button. It is a high contact area. It will take multiple passes as dirt is cleaned and released.
-   Although it doesn't look like it, the optical slot has a lot of dirt in the gaps around it because you are pushing the disc right up to that point for the drive to pull the disc inside. Placing those discs in there pushes dirt from your hands into the metal around the port. You different methods here.
-   If you use the toothbrush here: **Do not** insert the toothbrush bristles into the slot. You are cleaning the slot and the grooves around the slot, not inside the slot itself. Hold the head of the toothbrush with your thumb and index finger, and angle the brush to the bristles. Touch the edge of the slot without inserting the bristles into the slot itself. Prepare yourself to scrub them multiple times.
-   If you use the towel, then use your finger to apply pressure around the edge of the slot *without* pushing the towel inside of the drive.
-   Finish cleaning the display release button and optical drive slot with cotton swabs.


# The Right Side

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very low use: the security slot is rarely used.
-   **Do not** use compressed air in the exhaust vent. Internal cooling fans operate on their own power to push out hot air out of the laptop. Pushing air into the fan, rotating it by an external force, can damage it in two ways: it can spin the fan in the wrong direction, spin the fan faster than it is designed to spin, or both simultaneously.
-   Gently clean the AirPort antenna window if there is dirt on it.


# The Left Side

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very low use: people carefully inserted the PC Card, and there is nothing else to use on that side.
-   **Do not** use compressed air in the intake vent. Internal cooling fans operate on their own power to pull cool air into the laptop. Pushing air into the fan, rotating it by an external force, can damage it in two ways: it can spin the fan in the wrong direction, spin the fan faster than it is designed to spin, or both simultaneously.
-   **Do not** use compressed air in the PC Card Slot. Do not insert anything in the PC Card Slot either.
-   Gently clean the <span class="underline">cover</span> of the PC Card slot using a cotton swab. It takes barely any pressure to clean it without forcing the cotton swap inside the port or wearing out the spring mechanism on the cover.
-   Clean around the PC Card slot with a cotton swab.
-   Use a cotton swab to clean the PC card eject button.
-   Gently clean the AirPort antenna window if there is dirt on it.


# The Bottom

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very high use: you carry and pick it up here.
-   Set down the computer facing lid down.
-   Gently scrub out case screws using cotton swabs. You might be surprised at the amount of black dirt inside of the screw heads. Scrubbing them until the cotton swab is no longer black takes many passes. Consider the amount of dirt they pick up! If you are motivated, then study the correct order to remove and install these case screws and remove them to scrub the screw hold opening too. Otherwise, work on it another time.
-   With the lid facing down, you've got easy access to the back. Use the damp towel to wipe down the entire back surface, including the power port, ports cover, and Clutch Covers.
-   Now, use cotton swabs to clean stuff really stuck on there.
-   At its edges, the bottom curves up to meet the sides and the front. While you are cleaning, it is surprisingly easy to miss this surface. Pay attention there because they are high contact areas.


# The Battery & Battery Compartment

-   Follow the same process for the battery and its compartment.
-   Pay attention to dirt and wear on the battery. It is revealing of the overall condition and how well the laptop was taken care of.
-   Start on the top of the battery. Utilize the bright light to inspect the plastic edge around the battery. There is a slight gap between that plastic edge and the battery itself. Very fine dirt can get in there. Scrub it out with a toothbrush. It may take multiple attempts: remember that the bottom faced a lot of dirty surfaces over the years. Take multiple passes to complete this step.
-   Use the toothbrush to scrub the battery bay release slider.
-   Wipe the flat top of the battery and the battery status indicator button.
-   Remove the battery and hold it in your hand.
-   Wipe the flat bottom of the battery
-   Scrub the sides
-   Don't use the toothbrush near the battery connected: it could leak into the battery. Otherwise, the toothbrush is fine to use.
-   Now clean the compartment itself.
-   The compartment only has two surfaces to cleaning using the towel: the bottom and the top. The left side has a paper surface impossible to use Isopropanyl on. The right side has hardware information stickers like Model ID and NIC Address, and you don't want to wipe them off. Clean the left and right side carefully at your discretion.
-   Clean the bottom and top with the cloth and use a toothbrush for the many hard to reach spots on the top edge.


# The Back

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems very high use: it is frequently very hands-on as you attach and reattach often used ports like the power, Firewire, USB, Display, and Modem.
-   Consider taking a picture of the ports before cleaning them. Years of dust and dirt will accumulate back here, even tiny little things that you can barely see.
-   Inspect the back with the port cover both open and closed.
-   Wipe the port cover with the cloth.
-   Lower the port cover.
-   While supporting the now open port cover on the table or with your handle, wipe down the inside of the port cover. Stay within its acceptable range of operation. If you open it any further, it will damage the port cover.
-   **Do not** use compressed air in the intake vent. Internal cooling fans operate on their own power to pull cool air into the laptop. Pushing air into the fan, rotating it by an external force, can damage it in two ways: it can spin the fan in the wrong direction, spin the fan faster than it is designed to spin, or both simultaneously.
-   You don't want to force dust balls up into the ports. Manually clear the ethernet, USB, and Modem port of large dirt like dust balls first by using dental picks. If that can't pull them out, then use barely damp cotton swabs.
-   Blow the surface off with compressed air.
-   Excessive dirt may warrant doing one or two passes with the cloth before getting into detail with the cotton swab.
-   You may want to cotton swab down the display or TV-out port. Although it is usually hard to accumulate dirt here, it is definitely possible. Use a damp cotton swab without forcing any Isopropanyl into the port itself.
-   Clean the area with cotton swabs at least twice. There is a lot of dirt collected there.
-   If there is a lot of fine dirt accumulated on the top edges, then a dental pick dipped in Isopropanyl may do well to clean it up.


# The Deck Lid

The deck lid is the topmost structure of the laptop. Just like a lid sits on top of a pot, the deck lid sits on top of the computer. The deck lid is composed of:

-   The belt (the white composite ring around the laptop lid).
-   The palm rest.
-   The trackpad.
-   The speakers.
-   The keyboard.

Generally, follow the template for each location.

The details and exceptions are noted in each section.

Before doing anything, dampen the cloth and wipe down the entire deck lid because:

-   It will remove a lot of dirt.
-   It will start to loosen a lot of dirt.
-   It is fun to see large results so quickly.

When you work on the entirety of the lid, always try to wipe in a direction that won't collect dirt in the edge between two surfaces. As you get more and more efficient at cleaning, it is easy to overlook these details as you "get into the flow" of cleaning quickly.

Inspired by the kick-off to cleaning the deck lid, now move on to the next steps.


## The Belt

-   Follow the template.
-   The belt is made of composite material: it is not metal of any kind. Therefore it is weaker than the rest of the laptop. When you push towards it on the X-axis, it can easily bear the force of cleaning because it is resting right against the laptop body. However, when you push up and down on the belt in the Y-axis, the only thing supporting it is the right and left sides of its composite material belt. Therefore only clean it by applying force towards it on the X-axis with the body behind it. If you use too much up and downforce on the belt, you can feel a sliding movement and a gentle vibration of creaking sound, then stop immediately and correct your cleaning action.
-   The belt is a composite material covered with paint. Isopropanol is safe to clean with. Don't use any stronger solvent as it can remove the paint.
-   This area seems to be very high use near the palm rest and low use elsewhere. Additionally, the kind of dirt accumulation here is unique to the rest of the laptop. Consider everything that ends up on your hands in a given day or week. Most dirt easily cleans off; however, dirt on the belt is also combined with oil from your skin along with any other material ranging from Mountain Dew to Elmer's Glue. Cigarette smoke tar is another substance that accrues slowly tightly on the band. Over the years, it combined to form a non-sticky dried layer of grime. Each time you clean it, observe the towel. You can easily end up doing five passes to clean it off. The combination of multiple passes between both the towel and cotton swabs is an effective and well-suited approach here.
-   Since the belt wraps around the entire deck lid, there is a seam between it and the body. Dirt may be trapped in this seam. The decision you need to make is whether or not you think that you can get the dirt out of the seam without compressing it further in. There are two good options for cleaning it out:
-   Use compressed air. The goal is to launch the dir out of the seam. Point it so that the compressed air and its internal cooled liquid pointing away from the computer, the display, and any part of you, especially your eyes and skin. Place the nozzle tube directly against the seam and shoot the air out. The dirt should also launch out.
-   Use a toothbrush. This is harder than using compressed air. It is slow and tedious. Hold the toothbrush at a forty-five-degree angle to the seam starting on one end. Gently position the bristles near the edge of the dirt. Your goal is to lift up and launch out the dirt from the seam instead of "brushing them out," which will likely push them even further inside. In one continuous motion over the width of about 0.75" or 2cm, "gently push the bristles into the seam, move towards the dirt, start lifting up, and launch the dirt out: all in one snapping motion. Be careful where the dirt is launched. Study your results. If you think it will help wet the brush with Isopropanyl. Although it will be even more tedious: consider using dental picks following the same approach.


## The Palm Rest

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very high use: your hands are there all of the time.


## The Trackpad

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be very high use: your hands are there all of the time.
-   The "Getting Started" manual explains that you should never use solvents on it. Isopropanol has been safely used here many times by many people and is most likely safe for any computer. However, you should decide for yourself.
-   Use the towel to clean the large flat surface of the pad and the button. However, only clean in a direction from the outward edge to the center in order to prevent dirt from getting pushed below the seams. Use cotton swabs if you want to work more slowly here.
-   Use a cotton swab to focus on the overlap of the trackpad ring with the trackpad surface.


## The Speakers

-   Follow the template.
-   This area seems to be low use: you've never got a reason to touch them.
-   Work gently here: the speaker assemblies are sitting beneath the grill.
-   The built-in microphone is in the left speaker assembly to especially avoid it.
-   **Do not** force air or Isopropanyl into the grill.
-   The Power button:'
  - While you are working on the right speaker, clean the power button with a cotton swab.
  - First, remove the battery, so you don't turn the machine on, and replace the battery when you are finished.
  - There may be dirt collected in the indentations of the power button itself. You may be able to clean it out using compressed air, a toothbrush, or a dental pick; however, it can be very difficult to do so.


## For The Keyboard

-   Follow the template.
-   This area is extremely high use: it is where you type.
-   Carefully blow it off: your goal is to free dust, not push it under the keycaps. Alternate between moving left and right with up and down as you see fit being careful not to spray fluid from the can onto the screen.
-   Don't use the toothbrush: it will launch dirt under the other keycaps.
-   You are going to clean all of the keycaps going in this order:
-   Clean all of the "big keys" like Command, Return, and the Space bar first.
-   Note: After its first cleaning, the spacebar appeared very clean. A few minutes later, it still looked clean but had a slight haze on it. Repeated cleaning removes layers of fine accumulation of nearly transparent dirt. The dirt was so dried as to turn translucent, which is why you might always go over high use areas two or three times.
-   Clean the top row keys, the row with the Function and volume and brightness, and the directions keys on the bottom right part of the keyboard one key at a time.
-   For the remaining keys, you can clean as many keys as your fingers can comfortably reach.
-   For every key group, <span class="underline">perform the following</span>:
-   Put your dominant hand under the cloth, position (one to three of the following) your index, middle, ring finger together, and dampen the cloth using Isopropanyl around those fingertips. Don't drench it. Just moisten it. As it dries up, reapply more
-   Scrub the cap(s) multiple times until they are clean to your liking. Since you are likely doing this only once, consider overdoing it. Use enough firmness to depress the key and to scrub it with adequate pressure. However, do not push so hard as to damage the switch or keycap potentially.
-   Clean around the outer edge of the keyboard and the surrounding top.
-   Should you remove the keycaps to clean the key switches and surface below them?
-   That is up to you. An argument against it is that the keycaps can break when you take them off. An argument for it is that you want a nearly perfect clean, then it is better to have a clean surface beneath the translucent keys, even if it means replacing some that you've broken and you are likely never to see under there anyway.
-   The middle ground here is to clean only the most visible dirt under or between the keycaps. Dampen a dental pick with Isopropanyl. Your goal is to scrub using the brushes without pushing the dirt inwards towards the key switch itself. Gently bend and position the dental pick so that it makes contact using gentle pressure. Go slowly here. Move the cleaner back and forth one or two times and study the result. Pull removed dirt out. Don't spray it out with compressed air. Repeat until you are satisfied.
-   Dry lingering Isopropanyl with compressed air.


# The Display


## Bezels

-   Do follow the template on the bezels.
-   The bezels are surprisingly high use.
-   Let Isopropanyl get on the screen
-   Develop a technique for easily cleaning the bezels in a manner that makes it nearly impossible for you to touch the screen
-   One technique:
    - Dampen the towel.
    - Place thumb under the damp section of the towel.
    - Hold the top of the display with your other hand to support it.
    - Apply pressure to position thumb firmly on bezel while squeezing underneath with your index finger on the back.
    - Position the cloth right up to the edge towards the screen; however, in doing so, make the cloth tight between your thumb and index finger so that the cloth can go no further, essentially "locking" it in place.
    - Slide the cloth up and down to clean the surface.
-   Another technique: use cotton swabs. You get an equally clean result as technique number one. It just takes longer in comparison.
- Avoid the latch when you are using the towel. The towel will catch on the latch. It might damage the latch. It will damage the towel. Use a cotton swab instead.

## Screen

-   Put away all of your Isopropanyl related cleaning tools. Put away the bottle of Isopropanyl, the towel you were using, the cotton swabs, and the little cup for it. Move them to a different location. Having worked with them for so long just now, despite your goal of not getting Isopropanyl on the screen, it will be very easy to do so, and you probably will. It is human nature. By moving everything to another location, you make it impossible to get Isopropanyl on the screen.
-   **Do not follow the template on display!**

### Between the Bezels and the Screen

The edge of the bezel goes right up to the screen. Sometimes dirt can collect on that edge. It might some farfetched, by the simplest example to consider is when someone is sitting in front of their computer eating dinner and they cough. Some of that dinner will end up right in this location. Like other dirt, it will dry up and get further stuck in place. When you find this, you must address it before moving on to clean the screen.

The cleaning of the screen step won't address this kind of dirt. If you leave this kind of dirt for the next step, you will probably only aggravate the situation of your screen by moistening or spreading around that dirt, not removing it. You must address it here. First, consider its consistency.

Use a dental pick as an exploratory tool. Gauge the depth and consistency of it. If it is dry and easily removed, consider blowing it off using compressed air carefully. If it is dry and stuck on, then moisten it using plain tap water applied with a cotton swab but not wiped by the cotton swab. Now push on the dirt with the dental pick to see if it can be removed. Always push the dental pick or cotton swab up and away from the screen. Although there are always exceptions, try to avoid touching the screen at all costs.

If dirt is caked onto the screen, then it is OK to investigate further using the same approach with additional care. Do so at your own discretion.

With the bezels clean now, you can move on to the display itself.

### The Screen

-   Hopefully, the screen is a low-use area. Screen treatment varies wildly between owners.
-   Matte screens, when brand new, are challenging to clean and require great care. Cleaning a twenty-year-old screen takes even more care!
-   Only use cleaning products design to protect and maintain your matte screen.
-   **Only use cleaning products design to protect and maintain your matte screen**.
-   iKlear works perfectly.
-   Note that the Apple Getting Started guide says that you should use plain water to clean your screen.
-   Study the iKlear product and visualize how to use it, following through the directions in your mind.
-   You are going to be pleasantly surprised by how good your screen may end up looking
-   Simultaneously fold and squeeze the iKlear cloth to make a flat cushioned wiping surface. Clean using that instead of your fingers and fingertips. The ball applies pressure evenly, giving total cleaning coverage on the display and cleaning up to the display's edges. When you clean with your fingertips or hand, you'll get smearing and won't be able to clean up to the edge of the display—taking time here to do it right rewards you with a great looking screen in the end.
-   Either spray the cloth or spray the screen with the iKlear solution.
-   Since the TiBook screens are large, you may find it is easier to spray the entire screen. Try both approaches and see what works for you.
-   Practice in a small area near the bottom left or right corner.
-   Keep practicing until the cleaned area remains clean and pleasant looking with no streaks, lines, or cloudiness.
-   **Follow the directions left and right all the way up to the edge of the display**. It will take longer to do it the right way here.
-   Be careful to clean right up to the edge. If you are tired of paying less attention, you will only go up to the edge intermittently. When you notice this at the end of your cleaning, and you are tired and just want to finish, you may go against the cleaning technique and clean up and down instead of left and right. Resist the urge to do this: only clean left and right up to the edge. When you clean up and down, you end up with a screen that looks great in the middle and with a totally different finish on the outer edges. Learn how to clean the display correctly the first time, and you will have a great looking screen every time!
-   Be careful when you work near the display latch because the cloth will catch on it and tear.
-   After mastering its use, clean the entire display
-   The treatment dries quickly.
-   Review your work at an angle in the light. Your work will reveal issues or defects with the display so take note of them. Enjoy your display that is now in the best condition that it can be: it is a real treat owning these laptops, and the iKlear makes the screens look great.
-   **Note**: As you clean left and right as the surface reaches its perfect finish, dust immediately collects on the display. Dust landing here is OK. Polishing the display removes that dust. Now the display is "sealed" with an anti-static layer of polish.

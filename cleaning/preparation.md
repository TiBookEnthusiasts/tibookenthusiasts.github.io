"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."<br>

The PowerBook G4 Titanium user manual begins with:

> Your PowerBook has been designed so that you can set it up quickly and start using it right away.
> â€• Chapter 1: Getting Started

It is right: you can do it so easily and quickly that you are unlikely to have read another page from that manual! You are not alone. Macs are so easy to use that few read the user manual. Many readers are using Macs for the first time and rarely end up reading the user manual either! Before working on your computer, though, you should at least have a basic understanding of your computer's intended usage and expected operation to help keep you and the computer safe and working well.

**Before you do anything** read the entire "Getting Started With Your PowerBook G4" user manual for your laptop:

-   [400MHz, 500MHz](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/PowerBookG4_15inchOrigGettingStarted.PDF) "Mercury"
-   [550MHz, 667MHz](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/PowerBookG4_15inchGigEthernetGettingStarted.pdf) (Gigabit) "Onyx"
-   [667MHz, 800MHz](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/PowerBookG4_15inchDVIGettingStarted.PDF) (DVI) "Ivory"
-   [867MHz, 1GHz](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/PowerBookG4_15inch1GHz-867MHzGettingStarted.PDF) "Antimony"

Now, if you only read one section of this document, then please let it be this one! The [Supplies](Supplies.html) and [Workspace](Workspace.html) information are the most critical take away from this document. Although the remainder of the paper does provide useful details, only by using the right supplies and workspace, you are likely to do an excellent job no matter the strategy you follow. The supplies and workspace are the most important thing to get right!

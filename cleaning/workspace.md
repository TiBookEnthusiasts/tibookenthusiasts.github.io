Your cleaning workspace is as equally important to your goal as the cleaning itself. Take your time to set up your workspace because it will make your work more efficient, fun, and useful.

Create a workspace with the following attributes:

-   **Comfort:** Comfortable seating lets you focus on the task at hand instead of the pain forming in your back and shoulders. Take frequent breaks. All of your attention should be focused on your new TiBook.
-   **Fluids:** Since you'll be working with warm water and Isopropanol, you might be spilling them. Although neither water nor Isopropynol cause stains, it is messy, so have towels nearby. Consider working on a countertop or with a waterproof mat because Isopropynal will remove wood's finish.
-   **Lighting:** Configure bright, pure white lighting. You can quickly inspect the TiBook pre, during, and post-cleaning. Use the full spectrum light to see everything. Reducing eye fatigue will retain mental energy for your work. Clear light will help take detailed photos, not only fun for before and after but for looking into great detail during the actual cleaning process. Sitting directly below the light makes the entire process a lot easier.
-   **Safety:** You are sitting with and around Isopropanol, water, and electricity. Be careful. Never plug something wet into the power outlet. Never allow fluilds inside of your laptop. Read the warning safety label on the Isopropanyl bottle and follow it. Keep fresh airflow for easy breathing. Wear glasses prevent it entering your eyes. Use a fan or air-cleaner to keep fresh moving. Wear gloves to keep your hands dry.
-   **Workspace:** Use a large flat work surface. Consider sitting on the floor with your back against the couch when you work on your laptop. When you work on the power adapter consider sitting on a linoleum or file floor. Keep all of your work materials easily in reach. Leave enough space to turn your TiBook around and flip it over to work on it. Easy access to its broad side and tiny parts speeds up cleaning. Use boxes or blocks to elevate your TiBook so you can work more efficiently and closely on different sections. The boxes or blocks need to be stable and safe for resting your laptop on. Use an office chair that goes up and down in height to make it easier to work on different parts of your computer. Perhaps even easier is choosing to sit on the floor and resting your laptop on a collapsable tray that is about waist high (AKA a "TV Tray") instead of using blocks.

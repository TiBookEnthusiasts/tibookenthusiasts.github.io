# Cleaning the Power Adapter
{: .fs-9 }

"It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."<br>
-- Confucius

TiBook owners' maintenance style varies wildly. Some people keep their power adapter in a silicon case to make it easy to wrap the cables and keep it clean. Others use their power adapter as a makeshift hockey puck but on the pavement for pick-up street hockey games. You'll inherit a very different adapter for each of your computers. Clean them regardless. Here is how:

# Overview

TiBook power adapters consist of three parts:

-   The detachable <span class="underline">plug</span> to connect the power adapter to the power outlet.
-   The detachable <span class="underline">cord</span> to provide an extended corded plug.
-   The <span class="underline">adapter</span> to manage the electricity.
-   The <span class="underline">cable</span> from the adapter to your laptop.

The cleaning routine here is different from the TiBook because they are all plastic or rubber instead of metal or composite.

Plastic and rubber get brittle over time and crack. The adapter and plug itself appear to be rigid plastic, and it is sturdy. However, the cord and the cable are rubber and need somewhat gentler care.

The cord and the cable are rubber. The rubber has gotten brittle over time, and you need to be gentle with it. Avoid sharp bends. Don't use Isopropanyl on it because it will further dry it out, making it more fragile. Clean it using gentle cleaners. Don't use abrasive material on it. Wear gloves on both hands because you are working with warm water for as long as you do the cleaning. Remember that these are twenty years old and have multiple layers of dirt accumulated over them. When you stare closely at them after you think they are clean, you will notice a tiny little bit of a different color and realize more dirt. Cleaning these has the strategy of just keep scrubbing until you don't have to anymore.

Because all of the parts are pitch-white, you have your work cut out for you finding dirt. After all of your hard work, the good news is that they will look nearly as good as new. Using pure white light is essential for this work. When you are satisfied with its appearance, your job is complete. Unlike Computer cleaning, this portion takes a lot of effort in comparison when you are rewarded with a bright white power adapter though you will find that it was worth it.

Although this process is written sequentially and planned out, unlike the computer cleaning steps, you will find that you will just jump in and work on what your gut tells you. Since you are doing so much scrubbing here, you have to stay motivated and effective. Consider the steps here to be a good template for a starting point and apply them in the order that makes the most sense for you.

# Preparation & Strategy

This work involves a lot of tiny amounts of splashing water. It isn't a lot of water, but it is enough to be an inconvenience. For example, you will be cleaning a long cord. You either have to set it down to keep it off the floor not to get dirtier, or you have to set it on the table and leave the dripped water there. On top of that, you will have the cable battling you on rotating it. Cleaning the entire adapter is simple but takes a lot of moving and scrubbing and little bits of water flying around if you are not patient and focused. Take your time. It will go well. Consider finding a clean spot on a tiled floor to do your work in lieu of the table.

Mix up some hot water and dish soap. Use enough to keep it foamy. Prepare your workspace. Take out a scrub sponge, the toothbrush, and some towels.

Keep the Isopropanyl and its related supplies nearby too.

The process of the work will go something like this:

-   Visually inspect the part.
-   Use a towel with the soap solution to remove large debris that will make a mess. Expect spilled soda and dirt accrued from dragging the adapter across a dirty linoleum floor.
-   Use the sponge, first on the non-abrasive side, with some soap and water solution and wrap it around the part and gently scrub. Use multiple scrubs on each surface of the piece.
-   Complete the entire part, then wipe it down with a clean wet towel. The hidden dirt is no visible.
-   Now, use the abrasive side of the sponge. Place the part against a flat waterproof surface. Scrub it against the flat surface of your workspace and the part alternating between both sides. Wipe it down again with the plain water cloth.
-   Visually inspect it again. You'll find things that didn't show up before. You might want to go over the entire part again. Dirt tightly packed into the material by nicks and scrapes needs extra scrubbing.
-   Nooks and crannies require cotton swabs and Isopropanyl.
-   Upon completion, use compressed air to remove any moisture.
-   Do not plug the adapter back in until it is completely dry.

# Cleaning the Plug and the Adapter

-   Unplug the adapter.
-   Follow the strategy.
-   This area is relatively light work.

# Cleaning the Cord and the Cable

-   Unplug the adapter.
-   Follow the strategy.
-   This area takes a lot of work.

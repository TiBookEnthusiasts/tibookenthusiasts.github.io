# Focus on having fun with your Apple PowerBook G4 Titanium
{: .fs-9 }

{{ site.title }} gives you everything you need to make it happen.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Welcome, fellow enthusiasts!

The TiBook is an industry disruptor that disintegrated antiquated ideas about the impossible tradeoff between form and function: revealing that there is no compromise necessary when Apple does the job. TiBooks deliver high-performance computing in a beautiful form factor. Even better is that the TiBook lets you run both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X (10): on a single machine, you get to run two very well loved and supported Apple operating systems. Not to delve too deep into it here, but also know that a wide variety of other operating systems also run on TiBooks. Whether you are a newbie or an old hat to the TiBook, welcome.

This site aims to research, document, collect, archive, and publish anything and everything related to the Apple PowerBook G4 Titanium. It will always benefit from your contributions of any form in a constant state of iterative development: see [below](#about-the-project) for details.

Thank you so much for visiting.

Have a great day!
